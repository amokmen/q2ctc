# "Catch the Chicken" - modification for Quake 2

![title](imgs_for_readme/title.jpg)

## Game objective

![chicken](imgs_for_readme/chicken.gif) The object of 'Catch the Chicken' is to hold onto the chicken as long as you can without being fragged by your friends. You receive 1 point for every 10 seconds you hold onto the chicken(the time of course is variable). Players without the chicken can only hurt the chicken holder, not each other or themselves, so you can use big weapons as recklessly as you like.

## Features

- Any Quake II map works.
- New models, graphics and sounds!
- Short movie intro!

- Chicken holder can/cannot throw the chicken(after having it for x seconds)
